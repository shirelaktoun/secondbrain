## One-time Pi setup

If you are setting up a new Pi, you'll need to do some initial setup:

1.  Connect monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
2.  Enable wifi and enter password.
3.  Go to the main menu > **Preferences** > **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.
4.  On the **Interfaces** tab, select **Enabled** next to **SSH**.
5.  Select **Ok**.


>**To my future self**
>You've already done this on your Pi Zero, so shouldn't need to repeat it unless your wifi password has changed.
